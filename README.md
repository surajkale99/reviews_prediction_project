# Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Prediction

## 📝 Project Description
This project focuses on automating the analysis of customer feedback in the hospitality industry using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Customer reviews are critical for business growth, but manually analyzing thousands of submissions is time-consuming and inefficient. 

This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline that ingests raw, unstructured text reviews from restaurants and automatically classifies them into **Positive** or **Negative** sentiments. By extracting key text patterns, business owners can instantly gauge customer satisfaction, pinpoint operational bottlenecks, and track service quality over time. The system is designed to handle common textual noise like slang, punctuation, and filler words to deliver highly accurate sentiment scores.

## 🚀 Features
* **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans raw text by removing punctuation, HTML tags, and stopwords.
* **Text Tokenization**: Converts text into numerical data using Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF vectors.
* **Classification Pipeline**: Trains machine learning models to accurately predict review sentiment.
* **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, and F1-Score.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.

### 2. Installation
Clone this repository and navigate to the project root directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com
cd restaurant-reviews-prediction
```

### 3. Virtual Environment Setup
Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

### Data Preprocessing & Training
To preprocess the text data and train the classification model, run:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

### Making Predictions
You can use the trained model to predict new review sentiments via the command line or an interactive script:
```python
# Example snippet inside a Python script
import joblib

model = joblib.load('models/sentiment_model.pkl')
prediction = model.predict(["The food was absolutely delicious and service was fast!"])
print(prediction) # Output: (Positive)
```

---

## 📊 Model & Evaluation
* **Algorithms Used**: Multinomial Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* **Vectorization**: TF-IDF Vectorizer
* **Target Accuracy**: ~85%+ on the validation split.
